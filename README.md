👋 Hi, I’m Ansar Ali. I completed my Ph.D. in molecular biology and agriculture at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. My doctoral research focused on the development of the leaf epidermis and the coordination of various cell types in the epidermis, using the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage as a model system. We identified a chromatin-associated protein that balances cell division coordination with differentiation. I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at UT Austin, exploring how the cell cycle machinery regulates the coordination of leaf epidermal cells.

🌱 I’m eager to learn the basics of data science, particularly sequence data analysis.

💞️ I’m open to collaboration on projects related to plant leaf epidermis development.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m an extremely social person and love connecting with others!
